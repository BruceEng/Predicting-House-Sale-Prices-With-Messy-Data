This project focuses on using various predictor models to maximize predictability of Housing Prices

The data used for this project is drawn from a paper written in 2017 by _Dean de Cock_. You can read more about why the data was collected [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627 'here'). You can also read about the different columns in the data [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/307/data_description.txt 'here').

The paper presents a data set describing the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home values.  The data set was provided for students as a final project in an undergraduate regression course.

One important value of an estimated regression equation is its ability to predict the effects on Y of a change in one or more values of the independent variables. The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made without estimates of the effects that may result. It is the desire for particular results that drive the formation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.

The goal for this project is to use regression analysis in various forms of python coding and available library resources (sklearn.model, statsmodels, ...) to:

- determine what primary independent variables (house features) of the total 79 available are that best can be used as a predictor estimate for house sale price.
- determine how good the predictor equation is as a fit via various calculated values: RMSE (root mean square error), R-Squared value).
